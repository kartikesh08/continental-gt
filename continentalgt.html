    <h1>Continental GT 650</h1>
    <p>
        The "Continental GT" was the most powerful machine from Royal Enfield when it was launched in 2014 and is reminiscent of the café racers of the 1960s, including the Enfield model from 1966. It was equipped with a 535 cm³ single-cylinder engine that develops almost 21 kW (30 hp) at 5100 rpm. The John o'Groats to Land's End route was also used with this model, and the construction again proved its reliability.
        
        The Continental engine is a block engine - the crankshaft and gearbox are combined in one housing - and has intake manifold injection; The alternator is on the right of the crankshaft, the primary drive is on the left. The emission limits EURO 3 and 4 can be complied with. It has a 90 mm stroke and 84 mm bore and achieves a maximum torque of 44.0 Nm at a speed of 4000 rpm.

        The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a parallel twin retro-styled motorcycle introduced by Royal Enfield in 2018. It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company.

        In 2017 it was revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine. The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with relaxed ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a café-racer with minor changes for performance. Both models are sold in India, Australasia, Europe and the United States. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling large-capacity twin in the world,[1] and in 2020 the Interceptor 650 was the UK's best-selling big bike.
